# 🔐 Secure Face Access

Secure Face Access is a full-stack access control system that leverages **facial biometric authentication**, **blockchain-based logging**, and **role-based access approvals** to enable dynamic, secure access in large institutions and organizations.

In large institutions like universities or corporations, access control needs to be **dynamic and decentralized**. For example, imagine a student needing access to a restricted lab. Traditionally, this would involve IT or security personnel, which can lead to delays. But what if a professor could approve access instantly, directly from their dashboard?

That’s the problem **Secure Face Access** solves. By combining facial recognition, blockchain-backed logs, and a permission-based access workflow, we enable **seamless, secure access**—without unnecessary bottlenecks or middlemen.

Built with **Hyperledger Fabric**, **Python**, **React**, and **Firebase**, this system allows users to register and authenticate using facial recognition, submit access requests to authorized personnel (e.g., professors), and view access logs stored immutably on the blockchain.
