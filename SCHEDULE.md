## Day 3: Software Installation
- Set up Python environment.
- Install NVIDIA DeepStream SDK, CUDA, and TensorRT.

## Day 4: Basic Pipeline Test
- Run DeepStream sample pipelines to validate camera input and GPU acceleration.

## Day 5: Initial Object Detection
- Test simple object detection on static images/videos using OpenCV to ensure camera feed stability.

# Week 2: AI Model Integration – YOLOv8 / MobileNet
## Day 1-2: Integrate YOLOv8
- Import and test YOLOv8 using the Ultralytics package.
- Run sample detections on live feeds.

## Day 3: Model Conversion

## Day 4: Performance Benchmarking
- Measure inference speed and tweak parameters.

## Day 5: Pipeline Optimization
- Integrate the model into the DeepStream pipeline and perform initial real-time tests.

# Week 3: Incident Detection & Event Flagging
## Day 1: Define Detection Scenarios
- Map out key incidents (accidents, intrusions, violent behavior) and set classification thresholds.

## Day 2-3: Implement Event Flagging
- Develop code to trigger events when specific conditions are met (e.g., multiple detections within a short period).

## Day 4: Simulated Testing
- Use prerecorded videos to simulate incidents and adjust detection sensitivity.

## Day 5: Integration Check
- Log detection events locally (pre-blockchain) with metadata (timestamp, classification).

# Week 4: Real-Time Text Generation with DistilGPT-2
## Day 1: Environment Setup for NLP
- Install Hugging Face’s Transformers library.
- Set up DistilGPT-2 in your environment.

## Day 2-3: Develop Text Summarization Module
- Pass detection outputs (e.g., “person falling” or “intruder detected”) to DistilGPT-2.
- Generate short, descriptive summaries.

## Day 4: Module Integration
- Connect the text output with the event logging module.

## Day 5: Testing & Fine-Tuning
- Validate generated descriptions for accuracy and clarity during simulated incidents.

# Week 5: Blockchain Integration with Hyperledger Fabric
## Day 1-2: Hyperledger Setup
- Set up a local Hyperledger Fabric network.
- Define channels, especially for recording general events.

## Day 3: Chaincode Development
- Develop smart contracts to record incident metadata (time, location, event type, AI-generated description).

## Day 4: Blockchain Testing
- Write/read test events on the blockchain.

## Day 5: Integrate with AI Pipeline
- Connect your event logging system to automatically store detected events on the blockchain.

# Week 6: Dedicated Police Channel & Alert System
## Day 1: Design Police Channel
- Define requirements and access control for a dedicated blockchain channel for severe incidents.

## Day 2-3: Implement Alert Chaincode
- Update smart contracts to flag high-severity events (e.g., violence) and send automatic alerts.

## Day 4: Secure Channel Testing
- Simulate severe events and ensure alerts are triggered and accessible only to authorized nodes.

## Day 5: Integration Validation
- Test end-to-end flow from incident detection to alert dispatch via the dedicated channel.

# Week 7: Optimization & End-to-End System Testing
## Day 1-2: System Optimization
- Optimize the DeepStream pipeline with TensorRT (using FP16/INT8 modes).
- Fine-tune model parameters for real-time performance.

## Day 3: Full System Testing
- Run live tests with multiple camera feeds to ensure smooth operation under load.

## Day 4: Debugging & Feedback
- Address any latency, false positives, or integration issues.

## Day 5: Documentation of Testing Results
- Log performance metrics and prepare a summary for the next steps.

# Week 8: Deployment, Documentation, & Final Adjustments
## Day 1-2: Final Integration
- Merge all modules (video analytics, text generation, blockchain logging, alerting).
- Containerize the application (using Docker) for easier deployment.

## Day 3: Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation covering system architecture, deployment steps, and troubleshooting.

## Day 4: User Training & Demo Preparation
- Prepare a demo for stakeholders (e.g., security team, administrators).

## Day 5: Final Adjustments
- Collect feedback from the demo, perform last-minute fixes, and schedule future updates for continuous improvement.
